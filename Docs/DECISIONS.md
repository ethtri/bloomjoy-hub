# Decisions

Record decisions here so agents don’t “thrash” the stack.

## 2026-01-11 — Starting point and baseline stack (Loveable POC)
We are **not starting from scratch**. The current codebase started as a Loveable-generated proof-of-concept.

**Canonical baseline (keep unless a new decision says otherwise):**
- Frontend: **Vite + React + TypeScript**
- UI: **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**
- Routing: reuse what the POC already uses; if missing, default to **react-router-dom (v6+)**
- Auth + DB (recommended): **Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Storage)**  
- Payments (recommended): **Stripe**
  - Important: Stripe secret keys must be used **server-side only** (never exposed as `VITE_` env vars)

Rationale:
- We already have a working POC in this stack → fastest path is incremental hardening + extension.
- Supabase + Stripe reduce custom backend surface area for MVP.

**Note:** `Docs/BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md` contains an older “suggested technical approach” (Next.js). That section is not canonical—this file is.

## 2026-01-11 — Server-side surface for Stripe
Because this is a Vite SPA, we still need a **server-side component** for:
- Creating Stripe Checkout Sessions
- Handling Stripe webhooks (subscription/order state sync)

Approved options (pick one early; record the final choice here):
1) **Vercel Functions** in `/api/*` (simple monorepo, good DX)
2) **Netlify Functions** in `/.netlify/functions/*`
3) **Supabase Edge Functions** (keeps infra in Supabase)

Until the option is chosen, keep integrations modular (thin client wrappers + clear boundaries).

## Open questions (resolve early)
- Hosting target: Vercel vs Netlify vs other (impacts serverless function layout)
- Machines purchase flow in MVP:
  - Quote-only for all machines? or “Buy now” for Micro?
- Membership perks in MVP:
  - Sugar discount vs shipping perk vs both vs neither
- Lead capture destination in MVP:
  - Supabase table vs email provider (Resend/Postmark) vs both
