# Task Template (copy/paste into an agent)

## Goal
(What user-visible outcome should exist?)

## Context (read these first)
- `Docs/MVP_SCOPE.md`
- `Docs/DECISIONS.md`
- Any relevant feature section in `Docs/BACKLOG.md`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] `npm run build` passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes (if present)
- [ ] PR opened into `main`
- [ ] PR description includes “How to test” steps (localhost)

## Constraints
- Do not expand scope beyond MVP
- Keep changes minimal and reversible
- Do not reference bloomjoysweets.com unless explicitly asked

## Suggested approach
1) Propose a brief plan (max 10 bullets)
2) Identify files you will touch
3) Implement
4) Run verification
5) Update docs (status + smoke checklist if user-facing)
